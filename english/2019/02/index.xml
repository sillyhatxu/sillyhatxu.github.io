He&#39;s doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. Who uses calling cards anymore? You know what? That&#39;s a nice attitude, Ryan. I&#39;m just helping you invest in your future, my friend. It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme.</description>

      <description>s04e03-Launch Party And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They&#39;re unreadable. They&#39;re just numbers, and boring, and black. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic. Like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud. And, when we have a good quarter fireworks. Or a race car. Doesn&#39;t have to be a race car. Use your imagination. There&#39;s this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day.</description>

Doesn&#39;t it? It&#39;s going in a different direction than the other wires. I&#39;m really busy. I can&#39;t talk about this anymore. - Just shut up, Phyllis. - Get outta here. What are you doing?

Uh, oh, my god. Fire! Oh, fire! Oh, my goodness. What&#39;s the procedure?</description>

      <description>s09e16-Moving On No. You lied to me, Andy! You pretended to be in this office for three months, and you were sailing on your boat! - I resent that. I never lied to you. Really? &amp;quot;Hey, David, all is good in Scranton, P. A. &amp;quot; And all was good in Scranton, P. A. , that day. &amp;quot;By the way, Oscar says hi. &amp;quot; Oscar says hi all the time. He says all kinds of greetings hi, hello, hola.</description>

      <description>s09e17-The Farm Hold it! New glasses. Dwight, what a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died. Oh, Dwight, I&#39;m so sorry. Were you guys close? I would say that she raised me, but let&#39;s not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. My actual mother was very cold and distant.</description>

      <description>s09e18-Promos Oh, oh. She&#39;s doing it again. Phyllis has gotten into audiobooks. And lately she&#39;s been listening to 50 Shades Of Grey, which, if you don&#39;t know what it is, - it&#39;s a book about, uh, um-- - It&#39;s porn. Yeah. Seriously? This is unacceptable. It&#39;s officially a hostile work environment. Why? Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it&#39;s not okay to do this in public. Be careful.</description>

      <description>s09e19-Stairmageddon What the hell? No, this is not happening. Didn&#39;t you get the memo? It&#39;s Stairmageddon. Come on, Stanley! Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in 100 years. It&#39;s a &amp;quot;mageddon!&amp;quot; Come on!</description>

I got some really good sleep. - Did you? - Zzz. Yesterday was the first round of a branch-wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyerhammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product, Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper.</description>

      <description>s09e21-Livin&amp;rsquo; the Dream I&#39;m taking some time off from work well, my other work because we needed it. It&#39;s great. The phone&#39;s been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts. But that doesn&#39;t matter. This does. It&#39;s the only thing that matters. We&#39;ve had some really nice days together. Mm-hmm. Nice morning, too. Beesly. Oh, my God. Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas?</description>

      <description>s09e22-A.A.R.M. &amp;quot;The tea in Nepal is very hot. &amp;quot; &amp;quot;But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. &amp;quot; Last week, I finally became permanent Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton! My first project: Increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they&#39;re protecting America&#39;s real treasure Paper! Every morning, I email the day&#39;s security codes. Something that&#39;s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes.</description>
