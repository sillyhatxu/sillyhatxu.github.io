How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy? By wanting it more.
By working hard.
What's your mission statement? My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat.
I will never give up.
I am on a mission.
That is the michael scott guarantee.

No, no, no.
No, there's supposed to be the kickoff.
Kickoff.
My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible.
Chalk it up to teamwork.
All right.
And i offer same day, free delivery.
Michael, i don't know about this.
Nana, i really think that papa would want you To do this.
I'm not so sure.
Well, what ist exactly? What-- What specifically? It doesn't have to be paper.
We could sell medicine and other see, this is what concerns me.
We could just give him a chance.
It's not much money.
Well, this may not be the right time, But i need more than i originally asked for.
It's ???? an investment club.
- Okay.
- I love you, michael.
I do.
Okay.
But no.
I mean it.
No.
I thought nana raised some good questions.
What kind of a name is nana? It means grandmother.
Oh, sweet jesus.
Look, i'm sorry to do this, But can you drop me back at the telemarketing building? You know, michael, you want to succeed? You got to apply the same-- Get him, jim.
Come on, tough d, jim.
- AH! - Oh, my god.
Oh, wow.
Jim, what the phyllis, are you okay? Are you okay? No, i swallowed a crown.
Why'd you duck, jim? - What? - Yeah, jim, why would an experienced scer player Like yourself duck at the very last moment? Okay, i'm just gonna go get some ice.
Does that make you feel better? Huh? - I-I'm sorry, phyllis.
- Oh, yeah, jim's sorry.
Do you get tnt? The station? Do you get tnt? Yeah, i have cable and satellite as a backup.
Yeah, i know, two not-So-Great things in a row.
Well, well, stuff happens.
Right? At least we got ryan.
The ry-Guy.
We should call him ry-Bread.
We don't have to call him that.
Unless you like it.
We could call him that.
I can't do this.
What's that? I can't do this.
I had a real job.
I sat ten feet away from my fiance.
I had health benefits.
I was just feeling impulsive.
I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Yecch.
I just keep getting bored.
And i let things build up and build up, And then i do something too big.
Like this.
Who does this? Well, you know what? My mom always used to say that average people Are the most special people in the world, And that's why god made so many-- We don't have any money.
We don't have an office.
We don't have anything.
Well, we should make a list.
Lists are good.
Lists are good.
Lists are good.
First on the list, let's get you out of the car.
All right? Okay.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one who went with you? Is it because i'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you.
I want you to listen to me.
Because i want to tell you The situation that we are both in right now.
Okay? You quit your job.
I quit my job.
We both quit.
Those are the facts.
That's what happened.
Now what are our choices right now? Because, you know what, kiddo? You quit.
- Yeah.
- So what are our options? Well we can start this paper company.
We can try.
Or that's it.
That's o only option.
Because we quit.
Pam, i do my best work when people don't believe in me.
I remember in high school, My math teacher told me i was gonna flunk out, And know whai did? The very next day, i went out, And i scored more goals than anyone In the history of the hockey team.
See what i mean? I thrive on this.
I thrive on it.
So i'm gonna go inside.
I'm going to make some calls.
I'm gonna get us an office space, And i'm going to show you Why you joined this company, all right? You gotta have some extra space, billy.
Work with me here.
There's gotta be some sort of secret office That you have lurking around.
Something awesome and free.
And you keep it off the books.
Oh, no, not there.
That would be humiliating.
I did what i had to do.
I stepped in.
I took charge.
That's what being a man is.
And earlier today, i was freaking out.
Pam stepped up.
She was the man.
Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype.
Not mine.
Okay.
I could work here.
I could see this.
It's right in the middle of the pap belt.
Are you good? Yeah, i'm good.
You good? I'm good.
You know what they say.
Keep your friends close.
Michael.
- You're back.
- Yes, i am, charles.
Except this time you have no legal right to kick me out.
Because i have started my very own paper company Right here in the building.
If i were you, charles minor, I would watch your step.
Because the michael scott paper company is about to open A big old can of whoop-Ass on dunder mifflin.
Actually, a six-Pack.
We're gonna open a six-Pack of whoop-Ass.
He looked scared.
