 I haven&#39;t kept a diary for a long time because I&#39;m looking for new ways to learn English. I&#39;m a software engineer. Why don&#39;t just recite the interview question?   Question 1:
Given a text file of size say 100GB? Task is to find first non repeating word in this file? Constraints: You can traverse the file only once.

 I was wake up in the morning at eight twenty. I was so tired that I didn&#39;t get up. I opened my eyes as usual to brush my teeth and then went to work. I went to breakfast before I remembered it that I forgot about my phone. So I don&#39;t have time to eat. I bought a loaf of bread and went back home. That is why I was late today.</description>

 I was wake up in the morning at eight o&#39;clock. I opened my eyes as before. I put on my slippers and went to the bathroom brush my teeth. Do these sentences familiar to you? Yes, because I do it every day. Maybe I will do it every day. What did we talk about right now? Oh, I said brush my teeth. Then I go to work at eight forty.</description>

 I was waked up in the morning and open my eyes. I put on my slippers and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I feel so hot then I decided to take a bath. Then I put the rice into the lunch box. Iâ€™m so amazing because my Wife makes it yesterday. I set off for work at eight fifty. My feet hurt because I fell in the bath last week.</description>
